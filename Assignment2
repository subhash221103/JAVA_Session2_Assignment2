 * Generate prime numbers between 1 and 100 using for loop. A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. A natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number.
 * Use for loop and break statement to achieve this task.
